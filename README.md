# MATLAB-utils

This is a library of MATLAB utility functions. It contains many classes and functions that we've found useful across multiple projects, for uses such as:
 - Video loading, saving, and processing
 - Binary mask processing and visualization
 - File handling
 - And others

Many of the [Goldberg Lab](https://github.com/GoldbergLab) MATLAB-based repositories have dependencies in this repository, so it is recommended to have this repository in your MATLAB path before using other Goldberg Lab repositories.

We make a significant effort to avoid breaking backwards compatibility when updating this repository.

Download & unzip/clone this repo and add it to your MATLAB path to use these functions.
