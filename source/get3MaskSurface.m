% get3MaskSurface: Isolate the true voxels on the surface of true regions
% usage:  surface_mask = get3MaskSurface(mask)
%         surface_mask = get3MaskSurface(mask, kernel)
%
% where,
%    mask is a 3D logical mask
%    kernel is an optional argument indicating what convolution kernel to
%       use for counting neighbors. If not supplied, the default kernel
%       will count any voxel as a neighbor if it lies within a 3x3x3 cube 
%       centered on the voxel in question.
%    surface_mask is a 3D logical mask for which the true voxels are the
%       subset of true voxels in the original mask which are on the surface
%       of true regions.
%
% This function creates a new 3D mask for which vodels are true if they are
%   true in the original mask, and have at least one false neighbor in the
%   original mask. The result is a mask of only the "surfaces" of true
%   regions. With the default kernel, the surface finding algorithm is 
%   stable, in that applying it more than once iteratively has no 
%   additional effect; the surface of a surface mask is the surface mask itself.
