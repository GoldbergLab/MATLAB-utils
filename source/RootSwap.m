% RootSwap: GUI for swapping one drive letter for another in multiple paths
% usage:  alteredPaths = RootSwap(originalPaths)
%
% where,
%    originalPaths is either a char array representing a file path, or a
%       cell array of them.
%    originalRoots is an optional cell array of original roots to swap out.
%       Along with newRoots, if provided, will skip the GUI and simply swap
%       the roots as requested.
%    newRoots is an optional cell array of new roots to swap in. If 
%       provided, it must be the same size as originalRoots Along with
%       originalRoots, if provided, will skip the GUI and simply swap the 
%       roots as requested.
%    alteredPaths is a cell array containing the original paths with the
%       root drive letter swapped according to the user's GUI selections
%
% This is a wrapper for PathSwap that automatically fills in the
%   search/replace fields with the root directory of each path.
%
% If originalRoots and newRoots are provided, this will skip the GUI and
%   simply swap the roots using corresponding elements in the originalRoots
%   and newRoots cell arrays
